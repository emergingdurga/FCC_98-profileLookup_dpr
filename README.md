#Shantanu Look here for Explanation.

OBJECTIVE:
   To lookup a json collection and find and return the property value passed through the input argument(if the prop is present).
   
Steps:
Think your self as Mario and we are in the quest of finding our princess in a brothel. :D :D

1. A "count=0" variable is created (Durga's favourite way) to tackle if the contact exist or not.
  If in the end of all the process count becomes equal to the length of the contacts array then the name is not in the list.
  It sounds complicated but it isn't. :)
2. Then we loop through the json Object "contacts" and find the firstName passed by the argument.
3. If we get the firstName correct then use hasOwnProperty to see if the passed second argument is present in the found object or not. If property not found return "No Property Found". A clone of princess who has no boobs. BOOM.
4. And if by any chance we match the property then "Hey we have found the Princess. :D". Return the value of the passed property.
 
 And That is all folks.
Atlast the Mission of Mario is complete. He finds the princess and marries her.
And Then they live happily ever after. :) 
The End.
